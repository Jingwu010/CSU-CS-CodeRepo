Hydro-slotted perforation<====>35087381<====>Hydro-slotted perforation Hydro-slotting perforation technology is the process of opening the productive formation through the casing and cement sheath to produce the oil or gas product flow (intensification, stimulation).

Social emotions<====>35090653<====>Social emotionsSocial emotions are emotions that depend upon the thoughts, feelings or actions of other people, "as experienced, recalled, anticipated or imagined at first hand".    Examples are embarrassment, guilt, shame, jealousy, envy, empathy, and pride.   In contrast, basic emotions such as happiness and sadness only require the awareness of one's own physical state.

Studies have found that children as young as 2 to 3 years of age can express emotions resembling guilt  and remorse.

Southern Daly languages<====>35094118<====>Southern Daly languages The Southern Daly languages are a proposed family of two distantly related Australian aboriginal languages.   They are: Murrinh-patha (Murinbata)Ngan’gityemerri (Ngan’gi)ClassificationSouthern Daly is a distant and problematic relationship. Murrinh-Patha was once thought to be an isolate, due to lexical data:  It has, at most, an 11-percent shared vocabulary with any other language against which it has been compared.   However, Murrinh-patha and Ngan’gityemerri correspond closely in their verbal inflections.  Green (2003) makes a case that the formal correspondences in core morphological sequences of their finite verbs are too similar (in their complexities and their irregularities) to have come about through anything other than a shared genetic legacy from a common parent language.

Moment closure<====>35097048<====>Moment closureIn probability theory, moment closure is an approximation method used to estimate moments of a stochastic process.IntroductionTypically, differential equations describing the i-th moment will depend on the (i + 1)-st moment.  To use moment closure, a level is chosen past which all cumulants are set to zero.  This leaves a resulting closed system of equations which can be solved for the moments.   The approximation is particularly useful in models with a very large state space, such as stochastic population models.  HistoryThe moment closure approximation was first used by Goodman  and Whittle   who set all third and higher-order cumulants to be zero, approximating the population distribution with a normal distribution.

Fenchel–Moreau theorem<====>35099255<====>Fenchel–Moreau theoremIn convex analysis, the Fenchel–Moreau theorem (named after Werner Fenchel and Jean Jacques Moreau) or Fenchel biconjugation theorem (or just biconjugation theorem) is a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be equal to its biconjugate.   This is in contrast to the general property that for any function  f^{**} \leq f .    This can be seen as a generalization of the bipolar theorem.    It is used in duality theory to prove strong duality (via the perturbation function). Statement of theoremLet  (X,\tau)  be a Hausdorff locally convex space, for any extended real valued function  f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}  it follows that  f = f^{**}  if and only if one of the following is true f  is a proper, lower semi-continuous, and convex function, f \equiv +\infty , or f \equiv -\infty .

Annulus (botany)<====>35103406<====>Annulus (botany)An annulus in botany is an arc or a ring of specialized cells on the sporangium.  These cells are arranged in a single row, and are associated with the release or dispersal of spores. FernsIn leptosporangiate ferns, the annulus located on the outer rim of the sporangium and serves in spore dispersal.  It consists typically of a ring or belt of dead water-filled cells with differentially thickened cell walls that stretches about two-thirds around each sporangium in leptosporangiate ferns.  The thinner walls on the outside allow water to evaporate quickly under dry conditions.  This dehiscence causes the cells to shrink and a contraction and straightening of the annulus ring, eventually rupturing the sporangial wall by ripping apart thin-walled lip cells on the opposite side of the sporangium.

Bell CriteriaAtypianoneminimal: smooth nuclei, smooth contours, minimal variation in nuclear size, shape, and evenly distributed chromatinmoderate: many large, plump, irregular nuclei, 1-2 mitotic figuressevere:  obvious pleomorphism, enlarged bizarre nuclei with dense chromatin, giant cells, often multinucleated, enlarged, atypical nucleoliMitotic figuresEvaluation of the mitotic figures in a STUMP requires evaluation of 3 specific criteriaHairy extensions of chromatin must be present, extending from a central clot-like dense mass of chromosomes. 

Bowman 45<====>35112941<====>Bowman 45 The Bowman 45 is an ocean-cruising yacht produced by Rustler Yachts of Falmouth.  The yacht is traditionally lined and styled, but is built from solid glassfibre composite with a fin and skeg underwater profile. To achieve a good seakeeping ability for ocean cruising, the yacht is heavily constructed, and well ballasted.  In addition, the yacht incorporates a strong skeg hung rudder.   The production of the yachts on a semi-custom basis, and the small numbers of yachts produced each year, result in a significantly higher purchase cost than comparable yachts from mass-production companies.  The yacht is available in various degrees of part-completion as well as in factory-finished form. 

Logical Investigations (Husserl)<====>35112946<====>Logical Investigations (Husserl) Logical Investigations ( ) is a work of philosophy by Edmund Husserl, published in two volumes in 1900 and 1901, with a second edition in 1913 and 1921.  In Logical Investigations, which resulted from a shift in Husserl's interests from mathematics to logic and epistemology, Husserl maintains that mathematical laws are not empirical laws that describe the workings of the mind, but ideal laws whose necessity is intuited a priori.  Though Husserl abandoned psychologism, the doctrine according to which logical entities such as propositions, universals, and numbers can be reduced to mental states or activities, in Logical Investigations, some commentators have seen a revival of psychologism in its second volume.

2011 Wisconsin Act 23<====>35113348<====>2011 Wisconsin Act 23 The 2011 Wisconsin Act 23 established a requirement for nearly all voters to present approved photo identification to cast a ballot.  It was one of many new voter ID laws in the United States.  Act 23 was developed by Republican Governor Scott Walker and the Republican controlled Wisconsin Legislature during a walkout by Democratic lawmakers as part of the 2011 Wisconsin protests.Approved forms of identificationSection 1 of Act 23 specifies that only the following forms of photo identification are acceptable: A Wisconsin driver's licenseAn nondriver identification card issued by the Wisconsin Department of TransportationPhoto identification issued by the United States militaryA United States passport or passport cardA United States naturalization certificate, issued not more than two years prior to the electionAn unexpired receipt for a Wisconsin driver's license or nondriver identification card (this is given at the Department of Motor Vehicles, as Wisconsin's licenses and identification cards are printed and mailed from an outstate provider in California) A tribal identification card issued by a recognized Wisconsin Native American tribeAn unexpired identification card issued by an accredited Wisconsin college or university with a date of issuance, a date of expiration not later than two years after the date of issuance, the voter's signature, and further provided that the student also present proof of enrollment in said college or universityImplementationIn July 2011, the Associated Press reported that the Scott Walker administration was planning to close some DMV locations that could issue identification under the voter ID law and increase the hours that other DMVs were available.  The changes were made to comply with a requirement that every county have a DMV location open at least 20 hours per week.  A Democratic legislator said that the closures would occur in primarily Democratic areas, while the expansions would occur in primarily Republican areas.Two weeks later, the plan was replaced with a plan to maintain all existing DMV offices and create four new ones.   In July 2011, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT) sent an internal memo instructing employees that an applicant for an ID card must pay the $28 fee unless the applicant requests that the ID be issued for free.In September 2011, the DMV began posting signs instructing applicants seeking free "ID cards used for voting" to check the appropriate box on the application form.   As initially implemented, an applicant for an identification card was required to present a birth certificate.  The Division of Motor Vehicles maintains form MV3002, which allows identification cards to be issued without a birth certificate.  The form is not mentioned in publicly available materials published by the DMV, and a high-ranking DMV official was unfamiliar with the form.On September 2014, a procedure was implemented where applicants could supply birth information that would be verified with the State Vital Records Office for free. Legal challengesOn December 13, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit Frank v. Walker in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin seeking to block the Act as a violation of the U.S. Constitution.In April 2014, U.S. District Judge Lynn S. Adelman in Milwaukee issued a permanent injunction against the Act, ruling that the Act was unconstitutional as well as a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.    Adelman said that it was not shown that voters without acceptable identification could obtain it under the Act and that the state failed to show evidence of recent voter impersonation fraud.    Adelman's ruling marked that first time that a voter ID law had been found to violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Adelman found a violation of Section 2 on the basis of racial minorities not only being more likely to lack acceptable identification, but also facing additional barriers to acquiring acceptable identification.   In a separate litigation, on July 31, 2014, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Act by giving the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles discretion to waive fees, over dissent by Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, and Justices N. Patrick Crooks and Ann Walsh Bradley. Richard L. Hasen, Softening Voter ID Laws Through Litigation: Is It Enough?, 2016 Wis. L. Rev. Forward 100  The state appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and asked for a stay of Judge Adelman's injunction.On September 12, 2014, the same day oral arguments were held, a Seventh Circuit panel stayed Adelman's injunction, allowing the Act to immediately take effect, and Wisconsin officials announced plans to implement the Act for the November 2014 election.Judge Frank H. Easterbrook was joined by Judges Diane S. Sykes and John Daniel Tinder.   On October 10, an equally divided circuit voted 5-5 to deny rehearing en banc, over written dissent by Judge Richard Posner.  On October 9, 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the stay imposed by the Seventh Circuit, and thus temporarily barred the state from implementing the voter id law, due tothe proximity of the upcoming general election and the fact that absentee ballots were sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted, over written dissent by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.. On March 23, 2015, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari.  On October 19, 2015, Judge Adelman, entered the order denying the injunction.  However, on April, 12, 2016, the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, with Judge Easterbrook finding the plaintiffs could now challenge the law as it had been applied individually.    On July 19, Judge Adelman found that the state was applying the Act unconstitutionally, ordering the state to allow anyone who makes an affidavit of their eligibility to vote in the November general election. On July 29, 2016, in a separate trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in Madison, U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson also found the Act was applied unconstitutionally but ordering more limited oversight.   On August 10, 2016, the Seventh Circuit stayed Judge Adelman’s injunction, leaving in place Judge Peterson’s order. Judge Peterson held a new hearing after reading news reports in The Nation magazine that the state was ignoring his order. On October 13, 2016, Judge Peterson entered an order expanding his oversight but still not permitting voters to swear eligibility by affidavit.   The United States presidential election in Wisconsin, 2016 was held on November 8.In unrelated litigation, on November 21, the Seventh Circuit found Wisconsin Legislature’s 2011 redistricting plan was an unconstitutionally partisan gerrymandering, the first successful claim of partisan gerrymandering in the United States in thirty years.

As the verse appears in the dedication to Haywood's book, it is perhaps unsurprising that Sterling positions her as the most impressive of the three, writing:  Pathetic  Behn, or Manley's greater Name;Forget their Sex, and own when Haywood writ,She clos'd the Fair triumvirate of Wit.

L1448-IRS2E<====>35122152<====>L1448-IRS2E L1488-IRS2E is an object located in the Perseus star forming region.   A clump of dense gas and dust, L1488-IRS2E is one-tenth as luminous as our sun and thus is unlikely to be a true protostar at this time.   However, its density is high enough that it is ejecting streams of matter from itself, and so it is a likely candidate for the first discovered core in hydrostatic quasi-equilibrium.   This would mean that L1488-IRS2E represents an early phase in stellar development which has so far remained unobserved due to the short time that a star spends in this phase and the low luminosity which comes from a star not yet developed past it.

Similarly one can define tertiary cohomology operations from the kernel to the cokernel of  secondary operations, and continue like this to define higher cohomology operations, as in  .  Michael Atiyah pointed out in the 1960s that many of the classical applications could be proved more easily using generalized cohomology theories, such as in his reproof of the Hopf invariant one theorem.

Thiamine transporter<====>35131461<====>Thiamine transporter Members of this protein family have been assigned as thiamine transporters by a phylogenomic analysis of families of genes regulated by the THI element, a broadly conserved RNA secondary structure element through which thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) levels can regulate transcription of many genes related to thiamine transport, salvage, and de novo biosynthesis.  Species with this protein always lack the ThiBPQ ABC transporter.  In some species (e. g.  Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pyogenes), yuaJ is the only THI-regulated gene.  Evidence from Bacillus cereus indicates thiamine uptake is coupled to proton translocation. This family includes human solute transporters SLC19A1, SLC19A2 and SLC19A3.

Saccharide transporter<====>35131653<====>Saccharide transporter The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a multi-protein system involved in the regulation of a variety of metabolic and transcriptional processes.  The PTS catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell membrane.  The general mechanism of the PTS is the following: a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is transferred to enzyme-I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr).  Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three structurally distinct domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC)which can either be fused together in a single polypeptide chain or exist as two or three interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

Utility ratemaking<====>35132007<====>Utility ratemakingUtility ratemaking is the formal regulatory process in the United States by which public utilities set the prices (more commonly known as "rates") they will charge consumers.   Ratemaking, typically carried out through "rate cases" before a public utilities commission, serves as one of the primary instruments of government regulation of public utilities. OverviewHistorically, many different classes of business have been classified as public utilities, and thus have been legally mandated to go through the ratemaking process in order to determine the allowable service charges for their industry.  Although the classification of public utilities has changed over time, typically such businesses must constitute a de facto monopoly (or "natural monopoly") for the services they provide within a particular jurisdiction.

Shcramjet<====>35133851<====>Shcramjet A Shock-Induced Combustion Ramjet Engine (abbreviated as Shcramjet; also called Oblique Detonation Wave Engine (ODWE), or simply referred to as Shock-Ramjet Engine) is a concept of air-breathing ramjet engine, proposed to be used for  hypersonic, as well as, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) propulsion applications.   From the overall design point of view, the shcramjet engine is similar to a scramjet engine; however, unlike the diffusive mode of combustion in scramjet engine, a shcramjet engine combustion takes place across a very thin region of standing oblique shock and/or detonation waves stabilized over a wedge, blunt body etc.  Since combustion in a shcramjet engine is confined to very short region across the igniting wave, the combustor length in a shcramjet can be significantly shorter than the scramjet that requires a lengthy combustor for complete fuel-air mixing and combustion.

Turk's head brush<====>35134246<====>Turk's head brushA Turk's head brush is a type of cleaning brush where the bristles are arranged covering the end of the stem as a half-sphere, so that the end of the stem does not come into direct contact with the surface being cleaned, especially when cleaning the inside of a cylindrical object.  A larger type, mounted on a long stem and used for removing cobwebs, is called a Turk's head broom.  The name has long been in use for this type of brush, so named because its cleaning end resembles a "wild" head of hair.   Turk's head brushes and brooms are used for domestic purposes,  for cleaning artillery,  for pharmaceutical use,  for sweeping chimneys,  and for other purposes.

Middle income trap<====>35134341<====>Middle income trapThe middle income trap is a theorized economic development situation, where a country which attains a certain income (due to given advantages) will get stuck at that level.    DynamicsA country in the middle income trap will have lost their competitive edge in the exportation of manufactured goods because their wages are on a rising trend.  However, they are unable to keep up with economically more developed economies in the high-value-added market.  As a result, newly industrialised economies such as South Africa and Brazil have not, for decades, left what the World Bank defines as the 'middle-income range' since their per capita gross national product has remained between $1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices.

Meditatioun In Wyntir<====>35139168<====>Meditatioun In Wyntir Meditatioun In Wyntir is a contemplative poem in Scots by William Dunbar (born 1459 or 1460).  In the work, Dunbar describes how Winter lowers his spirits.  While beset by melancholy and insomnia, he meditates indecisively on thwarted ambition, ageing and mortality, causing him to become depressed.  The approaching end of Winter restores his sense of hope. The poem seems to be inspired by Dunbar's personal experience; his brief reference to dissatisfaction of life "into this court" might be interpreted as referring to the royal court of King James IV. The text is preserved in the Maitland Folio Manuscript.

Q-Vectors<====>35139871<====>Q-VectorsQ-vectors are used in atmospheric dynamics to understand physical processes such as vertical motion and frontogenesis. Q-vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the quasi-geostrophic equations and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations. On meteorological charts, Q-vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion.  Q-vectors are an alternative to the omega equation for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi-geostrophic equations.DerivationFirst derived in 1978,    Q-vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes, using the midlatitude β-plane quasi-geostrophic prediction equations:   \frac{D_g u_g}{Dt} - f_{0}v_a - \beta y v_g = 0   (x component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)  \frac{D_g v_g}{Dt} + f_{0}u_a + \beta y u_g = 0   (y component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)  \frac{D_g T}{Dt} - \frac{\sigma p}{R} \omega = \frac{J}{c_p}   (quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation)And the thermal wind equations:  f_{0} \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial p} = \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}   (x component of thermal wind equation)  f_{0} \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} = - \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}   (y component of thermal wind equation)where  f_0  is the Coriolis parameter, approximated by the constant 1e −4  s −1 ;  R  is the atmospheric ideal gas constant;   \beta   is the latitudinal change in the Coriolis parameter   \beta = \frac{\partial f} {\partial y}  ;   \sigma   is a static stability parameter;  c_p  is the specific heat at constant pressure;  p  is pressure;  T  is temperature; anything with a subscript  g  indicates geostrophic; anything with a subscript  a  indicates ageostrophic;  J  is a diabatic heating rate; and  \omega  is the Lagrangian rate change of pressure with time.  \omega = \frac{Dp}{Dt} .  Note that because pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere, a   - \omega   is upward vertical motion, analogous to  +w=\frac{Dz}{Dt} .From these equations we can get expressions for the Q-vector:  Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right]    Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right]  And in vector form:  Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial x} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T    Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial y} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T  Plugging these Q-vector equations into the quasi-geostrophic omega equation gives:  \left(\sigma \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} + f_{\circ}^2 \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial p^2} \right) \omega = -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} + f_{\circ} \beta \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} - \frac{\kappa}{p} \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} J  Which in an adiabatic setting gives:  -\omega \propto -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q}  Expanding the left-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation in a Fourier Series gives the   -\omega   above, implying that a   -\omega   relationship with the right-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation can be assumed.This expression shows that the divergence of the Q-vector (  \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q}  ) is associated with downward motion. Therefore, convergent   \vec{Q}   forces ascend and divergent   \vec{Q}   forces descend.  Q-vectors and all ageostrophic flow exist to preserve thermal wind balance. Therefore, low level Q-vectors tend to point in the direction of low-level ageostrophic winds. ApplicationsQ-vectors can be determined wholly with: geopotential height (  \Phi  ) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where   \frac{\partial T} {\partial y}  ), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind.  This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.In frontogenesis, temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients.  In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created. References

Siphonopidae<====>35140052<====>Siphonopidae  The Siphonopidae are the family of common caecilians.   They are found in Central and South America.   Like other caecilians, they superficially resemble worms or snakes. They are the sister group to Dermophiidae, also of South America.  Siphonopids are oviparous caecilians, meaning they lay eggs.  They have imperforated stapes and no inner mandibular teeth.  Like species of some other caecilian families, their skulls have relatively few bones, with those present being fused to form a solid ram to aid in burrowing through the soil.

Bed burial<====>35140069<====>Bed burialA bed burial is a type of burial in which the deceased person is buried in the ground, lying upon a bed.   It is a burial custom that is particularly associated with high status women during the early Anglo-Saxon period (7th century), although excavated examples of bed burials are comparatively rare. Anglo-Saxon bed burialsA number of early Anglo-Saxon bed burials, almost all dating to the 7th century, have been found in England, predominantly in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Wiltshire, but single examples have also been found in Derbyshire and North Yorkshire.   The beds used in these burials were made of wood, and although none have been fully preserved, their presence can be inferred from the presence of iron fixtures and fittings, such as nails, cleats, grommets, brackets, headboard mounts and railings, that outline the rectangular shape of the bed in the grave.

Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula<====>35140129<====>Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula In mathematics, the Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula describes the Euler characteristic of complete curve with coefficients in an  abelian variety or constructible sheaf, in terms of local data involving the Swan conductor.    and   proved the formula for abelian varieties with tame ramification over curves, and   extended the formula to constructible sheaves over a curve  . StatementSuppose that F is a constructible sheaf over a genus g smooth projective curve C, of rank n outside a finite set X of points where it has stalk 0.  Then \chi(C,F) = n(2-2g) -\sum_{x\in X}(n+Sw_x(F)) where Sw is the Swan conductor at a point.

Risk and actuarial criminology<====>35140140<====>Risk and actuarial criminology Risk and actuarial criminology, unlike many other theories of crime, does not focus on the causality of crime.  It believes the social world is too complex and interlocking to understand what causes a behaviour or action.  This theory seeks to understand the emerging forms of social control that may lead to crime, and concentrates on assessing risk. Major aspects of this theory are the norms and rules of a society that propel behaviour and private sectors getting involved in citizens lives.  This theory does not revolve around issues of justice, the criminal code, or laws, it focuses on questions of how to minimize risk of entrenchments on private security for the general population.

Usable fuel<====>35140174<====>Usable fuelIn aviation, usable fuel is the fuel on board an aircraft that can actually be used by its engines.  The opposite of usable fuel is unusable fuel.  Websters dictionary on Unusable fuel, visited 19 March, 2012 The unusable fuel figure is calculated for an aircraft fuel tank in "the most adverse fuel feed condition occurring under each intended operation and flight maneuver involving that tank".  The figure usable fuel is used when calculating or defining other key figures of an aircraft such as MTOW, zero-fuel weight etc.  Usable fuel is the total amount of fuel in an aircraft minus the fuel that cannot be fed into the engine(s): fuel under the pump-intake, fuel behind ribs of a tank, fuel in lines between the tanks and the engines etc.

Epilachninae<====>35140434<====>Epilachninae The Epilachninae are a subfamily of the family of lady beetles, the Coccinellidae, in the order Coleoptera.  Superficially, they look much like other ladybirds in the larger subfamily Coccinellinae, but they differ importantly in their biology, in that the members of the subfamily are largely or completely leaf-feeding herbivores rather than being predators.  Accordingly, several members of the subfamily are crop pests, and sometimes cause locally serious crop losses. OverviewThe Epilachninae constitute about 16% of the described species of the Coccinellidae.  Their identification is no problem in the field when examining routine crop damage, because they are selective feeders, but a specimen obtained out of context can be troublesome; their markings are not consistent, so offhand identification is unreliable.

Who's Feeling Young Now?<====>35145198<====>Who's Feeling Young Now? Who's Feeling Young Now? is the third album by Punch Brothers.  The album was released February 14, 2012.

The album is more accessible than the band's previous work, based on a decision not to over-complicate the music: "instead of adding parts, you’re reinforcing existing parts. " "Movement and Location", a song written by Chris Thile, a long time baseball fan of the Chicago Cubs, was inspired by former Cubs pitcher Greg Maddux's obsession over the movement and location of his pitches.

Quantum oscillations (experimental technique)<====>35146189<====>Quantum oscillations (experimental technique) In condensed matter physics, Quantum oscillations describes a series of related experimental techniques used to map the Fermi surface of a metal in the presence of a strong magnetic field.These techniques are based on the principle of Landau quantization of Fermions moving in a magnetic field.For a gas of free fermions in a strong magnetic field, the energy levels are quantized into bands, called the Landau levels, whose separation is inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.  In a quantum oscillation experiment, the external magnetic field is varied, which causes the Landau levels to pass over the Fermi surface, which in turn results in oscillations of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level; this produces oscillations in the many material properties which depend on this, including resistance (the Shubnikov-de Haas effect), Hall resistance,  and magnetic susceptibility (the de Haas-van Alphen effect).

Autogenic inhibition reflex<====>35151555<====>Autogenic inhibition reflexAutogenic inhibition reflex is a sudden relaxation of muscle upon development of high tension.

Autogenic inhibition (historically known as the inverse myotatic reflex or autogenetic inhibition) refers to a reduction in excitability of a contracting or stretched muscle, that in the past has been solely attributed to the increased inhibitory input arising from Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) within the same muscle.  The reduced efferent (motor) drive to the muscle by way of autogenic inhibition is a factor believed to assist target muscle elongation.

For the true hardgainer, the issue lies deeper beneath any of the required elements of muscle gain listed above.

Cartier duality<====>35152335<====>Cartier dualityIn mathematics,Cartier duality is a analogue of Pontryagin duality for commutative group schemes.  It was introduced by  . Definition using charactersGiven any finite flat commutative group scheme G over S, its Cartier dual is the group of characters, defined as the functor that takes any S-scheme T to the abelian group of group scheme homomorphisms from the base change G T  to G m,T  and any map of S-schemes to the canonical map of character groups.   This functor is representable by a finite flat S-group scheme, and Cartier duality forms an additive involutive antiequivalence from the category of finite flat commutative S-group schemes to itself.

Common-path interferometer<====>35152689<====>Common-path interferometerA common-path interferometer is class of interferometers in which the reference beam and sample beams travel along the same path.  Examples include the Sagnac interferometer, Zernike phase-contrast interferometer, and the point diffraction interferometer.  A common-path interferometer is generally more robust to environmental vibrations than a "double-path interferometer" such as the Michelson interferometer or the Mach–Zehnder interferometer.

Personal RF safety monitors<====>35152779<====>Personal RF safety monitorsElectromagnetic field densitometers measure the exposure to electromagnetic radiation in certain ranges of theelectromagnetic spectrum.  This article concentrates on densitometers used in the telecommunication industry, which measure exposure to radio spectrum radiation.  Other densitometers, like extremely low frequency densitometers which measure exposure to radiation from electric power lines, also exist.  The major difference between a "Densitometer" and a "Dosimeter" is that a Dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose, which does not exist for RF Monitors.  Monitors are also separated by "RF Monitors" that simply measure fields and "RF Personal Monitors" that are designed to function while mounted on the human body.

Phase-contrast X-ray imaging<====>35154335<====>Phase-contrast X-ray imagingPhase-contrast X-ray imaging (PCI) or phase-sensitive X-ray imaging is a general term for different technical methods that use information concerning changes in the phase of an X-ray beam that passes through an object in order to create its images.  Standard X-ray imaging techniques like radiography or computed tomography (CT) rely on a decrease of the X-ray beam's intensity (attenuation) when traversing the sample, which can be measured directly with the assistance of an X-ray detector.  In PCI however, the beam's phase shift caused by the sample is not measured directly, but is transformed into variations in intensity, which then can be recorded by the detector.

Magnetic lattice (accelerator)<====>35154764<====>Magnetic lattice (accelerator) In accelerator physics, a magnetic lattice is a composition of electromagnets at given longitudinal positions around the vacuum tube of a particle accelerator, and thus along the path of the enclosed charged particle beam.  The lattice properties have a large influence on the properties of the particle beam, which is shaped by magnetic fields.  Lattices can be closed (cyclic accelerators like the synchrotrons), linear (for linac facilities) and are also used at interconnects between different accelerator structures (transfer beamlines). Such a structure is needed for focusing of the particle beam in modern, large-scale facilities.  Its basic elements are dipole magnets for deflection, quadrupole magnets for Strong focusing, sextupole magnets for correction of chromatic aberration, and sometimes even higher order magnets.

Conserved signature indels<====>35155103<====>Conserved signature indelsConserved signature inserts and deletions (CSIs) in protein sequences provide an important category of  molecular markers for understanding phylogenetic relationships.   CSIs, brought about by rare genetic changes, provide useful phylogenetic markers that are generally of defined size and they are flanked on both sides by conserved regions to ensure their reliability.  While indels can be arbitrary inserts or deletions, CSIs are defined as only those protein indels that are present within conserved regions of the protein. The CSIs that are restricted to a particular clade or group of species, generally provide good phylogenetic markers of common evolutionary descent.

Residue curve<====>35156653<====>Residue curveA residue curve describes the change of the composition of the liquid phase of a chemical mixture during continuous evaporation at the condition of vapor–liquid equilibrium (open distillation).  Multiple residue curves for a single system are called residue curves map. Residue curves allow testing the feasibility of a separation of mixtures and therefore are a valuable tool in designing distillation processes.  Residue curve maps are typically used for examining ternary mixtures  which can't be easily separated by distillation because of azeotropic points or too small relative volatilities. CharacteristicsResidue curves start at the composition of a feed and then move to pure components or azeotropic points with higher temperatures (isobaric condition) or lower vapor pressures (isothermal condition).
